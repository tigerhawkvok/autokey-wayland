#  Testing AutoKey on Wayland
Wayland support is limited to GNOME-based desktops.  It relies on a custom GNOME Shell extension to provide the information it needs about desktop windows.

This version of AutoKey still supports X11 desktops.  You should be able to switch between Wayland and X11 desktop environments without any problems.  AutoKey looks at the XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable to determine whether or not it is running in Wayland.

Basic testing of this version of AutoKey has been done on:
- Ubuntu 24.04 (GNOME Shell 46.0) - under Wayland and X11
- Fedora 40 Workstation (GNOME Shell 46.6) - under Wayland and X11
- Fedora 41 Workstation (GNOME Shell 47.2) - under Wayland only, X11 is deprecated in this release


## 1) Install the "uv" tool

`sudo snap install astral-uv --classic`


## 2) Clone autokey-wayland repository and run the setup script
```
#  Clone autokey-wayland repository
# Start where you want the code to live, eg, ~/script_src
git clone https://github.com/dlk3/autokey-wayland
```
For all subsequent commands, make sure you're in the repository directory

```
cd autokey-wayland
```

Run the python setup script to install AutoKey and its GNOME Shell extension. You'll be prompted to restart your computer at the end of the setup.

```
python3 ./setupAutokeyUbuntu.py
```

## 2b) Install Fedora system prereqs when prompted, if applicable:
```
sudo dnf -y group install c-development
sudo dnf -y install git make cmake dbus-glib-devel python3-devel cairo-devel gobject-introspection-devel cairo-gobject-devel
cd ~/src/autokey
xargs -a rpm-requirements.txt sudo dnf -y install
```
## 3) Post-Restart

### 3.1) Enable the GNOME Shell extension and add your userid to the "input" user group
Run this script:

```
./autokey-user-config
```

You will be prompted to log off and log back on again after running that script.

###  3.2) Install AutoKey in a Python virtual environment

UV will handle the virtual environment for you.  Run this command:

```
uv sync --all-packages --all-groups --all-extras --frozen
```

If this fails, you may need to run `uv lock` first, but this will re-sync dependencies so versions may change.

### 3.3) [Optional] Backup existing AutoKey configuration
```
#  Backup your existing autokey configuration files, this new version of autokey will modify them:
cp -R ~/.config/autokey ~/.config/autokey-backup
```

### 3.4)  Start AutoKey for the first time

```
#  Run autokey
uv run --directory lib python -m autokey.gtkui -vc
```

On subsequent runs, start AutoKey with the same command.

**Important** When AutoKey starts, it does not open a window unless this is your very first time running AutoKey, i.e., the ```~/.config/autokey``` directory does not exist.  Instead, it places an "A" icon in the system tray through which its main window and other functions can be accessed.

If you are a GNOME desktop user, your desktop may not have a system tray and therefore it will appear that nothing happened when you started AutoKey.  To use AutoKey effectively you should install a GNOME Shell extension that adds a system tray to your desktop.  My personal favorite extension for this purpose is "AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support by 3v1n0" but there are other choices.  Ubuntu, for example, comes with the "Ubuntu Appindicators" extension already installed so this isn't a problem there.  Go to [https://extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org) to find, install, and manage GNOME Shell extensions on your desktop.

If you don't already have the AutoKey icons installed on your system from some prior version of AutoKey, AutoKey will show up in the system tray not as an "A" icon but as an unknown three dot icon.
Step 4 will fix that.

## 4) Installing the AutoKey icons
If you don't already have the AutoKey icons installed on your system from some prior version of AutoKey then install them:
```
mkdir ~/.local/share/icons   #  If you don't already have this directory
cd ~/src/autokey/config/
cp -vr *.png *.svg Humanity ubuntu-mono-* ~/.local/share/icons/
```
## 5) AutoKey doesn't see my keyboard/mouse when I'm on Wayland

AutoKey on Wayland tries to attach to all of the keyboards and mice attached to the system.  However, it only recognizes devices that have the word "keyboard" or "mouse" in their names so it may not have recognized your device(s).  You will get an error message from AutoKey if it can't recognize at least one keyboard and one mouse.  This section provides a more detailed explanation of the actions suggested by the error message.

To help AutoKey recognize all of the keyboards and mice that you use, you should add the names of the ones that AutoKey missed to the AutoKey configuration file to help it find them next time.

First step, you need the names of the devices you want to add.  When AutoKey is run with the "-v" option it outputs a list of all the devices it sees on the system, and the ones that it "grabbed" because it recognized them as keyboards or mice.  On my system that list looks like this:
```
2025-01-01 17:13:02,386 DEBUG - autokey.uinput_interface - The following devices are available on this system:

        Logitech K400
2025-01-01 17:13:02,386 DEBUG - autokey.uinput_interface - I grabbed these devices from that list:
```
In my case, none of my devices have the words "keyboard" or "mouse" in their names so AutoKey wasn't able to recognize and didn't grab anything.  I got an error message saying that AutoKey couldn't find a keyboard device on my system.

To fix this I will update my AutoKey configuration file with the names of the keyboards and mice that AutoKey missed.

 1. I edit ~/.config/autokey/autokey.json and find these elements in the JSON object:

        "keyboard": null,
        "mouse": null,

 2. I add the names of my unrecognized keyboard and mouse devices.  In my case I have two keyboards so those are added as a list of names in the ```[ "name1", "name2" ]``` format.  I only use one mouse so its name can be entered as a single string.

        "keyboard": [
            "Logitech K330",
            "Logitech K400"
        ],
        "mouse": "Logitech ERGO M575",

Pay attention to where you put commas in JSON files.  JSON is very picky about that.

The Logitech K400 is a USB keyboard that I don't always have attached to the system, but I include it here so that AutoKey will recognize it when I do plug it in.  AutoKey can recognize new devices when they are plugged into a running system provided it knows their names, or their names have the words "keyboard" or "mouse" in them, same as before.

Now, when I restart AutoKey I see this in the log:

    2025-01-01 17:15:27,125 DEBUG - autokey.uinput_interface - I grabbed these devices from that list:
            Logitech K330
            Logitech K400
            Logitech ERGO M575

AutoKey has recognized and "grabbed" all my input devices.
## 6) Some of my hotkey definitions changed and I didn't do it
This version of AutoKey works under both X11 and Wayland.  If you switch back and forth between these two environments, the names used for some of the modifier keys used in hotkey combinations can change and this can mess with your hotkey definitions.  This will eventually get fixed but it won't be a trivial effort.  For now the assumption is that most people will stay in either the X11 or Wayland environments and won't switch back and forth, making this a low-priority issue.  If that's an incorrect assumption, let us know with [a bug report](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues/new/choose).

## 7) Cleaning up after ourselves
To completely remove the test version of Autokey:
```
#  If you installed the AutoKey icon files in ~/.local/share/icons, then:
find ~/.local/share/icons -iwholename \*/autokey\* -delete

rm -fr ~/src/autokey
rm -fr ~/venv
gnome-extensions disable autokey-gnome-extension-autokey@autokey
gnome-extensions uninstall autokey-gnome-extension-autokey@autokey
sudo rm /etc/udev/rules.d/10-autokey.rules
sudo usermod -r -G input $USER
mv ~/.config/autokey-backup ~/.config/autokey
sudo shutdown -r now
```
